This lesson introduces the use of Octave on the Compute Canada National General Purpose Clusters (Graham, Cedar and Beluga). While most production work on the National Systems is carried out by submitting batch jobs to the scheduler this lesson focusses on the the pre-production and post-production tasks associated with using Octave on the clusters. These tasks include data management, interactive IDE development, debugging and performance profiling as well as data visualization.
